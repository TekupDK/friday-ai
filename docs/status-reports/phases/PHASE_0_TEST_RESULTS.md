# Phase 0 Testing Results

## Test Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Date:** 2025-11-02
**Tester:** Automated Test Suite

## Summary

### ✅ Completed

- Database migration successful
- All Phase 0 code components implemented
- Docker service configured

### ⚠️ Needs Attention

- Webhook endpoint testing (JSON parsing issues in test environment)
- End-to-end integration testing pending

### Completed Tests

#### 1. Database Migration ✅

**Status:** PASSED
**Command:** `pnpm db:push`
**Result:** Migration applied successfully

- Created migration file: `drizzle\0003_minor_lester.sql`
- All new tables created:
  - `emails` ✅
  - `attachments` ✅
  - `emailPipelineState` ✅
  - `emailPipelineTransitions` ✅
  - `emailLabelRules` ✅

#### 2. Webhook Endpoint Testing ⚠️

**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Debugging
**Issue:** Webhook returning 400 status with empty response

**Test Details:**

- Endpoint: `POST http://localhost:3000/api/inbound/email`
- Test script: `test-inbound-email.js`
- Request payload: Valid JSON with `from`, `to`, `subject`, `text`, `html`, `receivedAt`, `messageId`

**Current Behavior:**

- Status Code: 400
- Response: Empty
- Server logs: Checking for handler execution

**Next Steps:**

1. Verify handler is being called
1. Check if body parsing is working
1. Verify database connection
1. Test with curl directly

### Pending Tests

#### 3. Database Insertion

- [ ] Verify email is inserted into `emails` table
- [ ] Verify thread grouping via `threadKey`
- [ ] Verify `emailThreads` entry is created

#### 4. Enrichment Pipeline

- [ ] Verify Billy customer lookup
- [ ] Verify lead source detection (Rengøring.nu)
- [ ] Verify auto-labeling ("Needs Action")
- [ ] Verify pipeline state creation

#### 5. tRPC Endpoints

- [ ] Test `getInboundEmails` query
- [ ] Test `getEmailById` query
- [ ] Test `getEmailThread` query
- [ ] Verify filtering by `stage`, `source`, `customerId`

#### 6. Attachment Handling

- [ ] Test attachment storage
- [ ] Verify attachment metadata in database

## Known Issues

1. **Webhook 400 Error**: Handler receiving request but returning 400 with empty response
   - **Possible Causes:**
     - Body parsing issue
     - Validation failing
     - Response not being sent properly
   - **Debug Actions:**
     - Added detailed logging to handler
     - Checking Docker logs for handler execution

1. **Empty Response**: Response body is empty even though handler should return JSON
   - **Possible Causes:**
     - Response not being sent
     - Error before response
     - Connection closing early

## Next Actions

1. Check Docker logs for handler execution
1. Test with curl for direct HTTP testing
1. Verify Express JSON middleware is working
1. Test database connection independently
1. Create test database record manually to verify schema
