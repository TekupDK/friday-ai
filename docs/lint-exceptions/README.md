# Lint Exceptions

This folder contains Markdown documents that intentionally deviate from the repository markdownlint rules.

Use sparingly and document the rationale at the top of the file:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD0XX MD0YY -->

Reason: <short explanation>

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD0XX MD0YY -->

Alternatively, place the file here if disabling at-file scope is preferred.

Notes:

- Keep this list small and review periodically.
- Prefer fixing the source content or amending rules if many files require exceptions.
