## 🔄 Remaining Tasks

### Infrastructure (P1 - High Priority)
- [ ] Add Sentry environment variables to .env.prod
  - Same DSNs or separate production projects
  - Required for production deployment

### Configuration (P2 - Medium Priority)
- [ ] Configure Sentry alerts in Sentry dashboard
  - Alert rule: "An issue is created"
  - Condition: "More than 10 occurrences in 1 minute"
  - Action: Email/Slack notification
  - Optional but recommended

### Testing (P2 - Medium Priority)
- [ ] Integration testing in development environment
  - Start dev server
  - Verify Sentry initialization in logs
  - Trigger test error in browser
  - Verify error appears in Sentry dashboard
  - Test both server and client errors

### Documentation (P3 - Low Priority)
- [ ] Add production deployment guide
  - How to set up production Sentry projects
  - How to configure production alerts
  - Best practices for production monitoring
