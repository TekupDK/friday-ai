   - API or tRPC routes
   - Frontend components and pages
3) List the files that need to be created or modified.
4) Implement the feature in small, safe steps.
5) Add or update tests.
6) Run relevant tests and typechecks.

## OUTPUT

Provide:
- A summary of the implementation
- Files touched
- Tests added/updated
- Any follow-up TODOs.
