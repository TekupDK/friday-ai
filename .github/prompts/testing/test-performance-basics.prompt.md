# Test Performance Basics

You are exploring basic performance characteristics.

## TASK

Add or propose simple performance tests for critical code paths.

## STEPS

1) Identify performance-sensitive code (loops, DB calls, heavy computations).
2) Suggest micro-benchmarks or load scenarios where appropriate.
3) Propose metrics to capture: latency, throughput, memory.
4) Provide pseudo-code or high-level test descriptions.

## OUTPUT

Return:
- Critical paths list
- Suggested performance tests
- Metrics to track.
