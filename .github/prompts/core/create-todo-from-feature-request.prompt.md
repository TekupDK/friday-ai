# Create Todo from Feature Request

You are converting a feature request into actionable TODO items.

## TASK

Take a feature request and break it down into implementable TODO tasks.

## STEPS

1) Understand the feature:
   - Read feature description
   - Identify user needs
   - Check for acceptance criteria
   - Review any mockups or designs

2) Design the implementation:
   - Identify backend changes needed
   - Identify frontend changes needed
   - Check for database schema changes
   - Consider API/tRPC procedures needed

3) Break into tasks:
   - Database schema (if needed)
   - Backend logic and services
   - API/tRPC procedures
   - Frontend components
   - Integration work
   - Testing
   - Documentation

4) Structure TODO items:
   - Clear task descriptions
   - File references where known
   - Priority (usually P2 for features)
   - Size estimates
   - Dependencies (order matters)

5) Add metadata:
   - Link to feature request
   - User stories if provided
   - Design references
   - Acceptance criteria

## OUTPUT

Provide:
- Complete TODO breakdown
- Tasks organized by area (backend/frontend/etc.)
- Dependencies clearly marked
- Priority and size estimates
- Implementation notes
