# Split Large Todo

You are breaking down a large TODO task into smaller, manageable pieces.

## TASK

Take a large or complex TODO item and split it into smaller tasks.

## STEPS

1) Analyze the large task:
   - Understand the full scope
   - Identify distinct components
   - Find natural breakpoints
   - Check for logical phases

2) Identify sub-tasks:
   - Break by area (backend/frontend)
   - Break by feature component
   - Break by implementation phase
   - Break by dependency order

3) Create smaller tasks:
   - Each should be independently completable
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Appropriate size (S or M)
   - Dependencies clearly marked

4) Structure the breakdown:
   - Parent task (original)
   - Sub-tasks with clear descriptions
   - Order of execution
   - Dependencies between sub-tasks

5) Update priorities:
   - Keep original priority for critical path
   - Adjust sub-task priorities if needed
   - Mark which sub-tasks are blockers

## OUTPUT

Provide:
- Original task (marked as parent)
- List of sub-tasks created
- Dependencies between sub-tasks
- Recommended execution order
- Updated TODO list structure
