# Cleanup Completed Todos

You are cleaning up a TODO list by archiving completed items and organizing remaining work.

## TASK

Review a TODO list, archive completed items, and organize what remains.

## STEPS

1) Identify completed tasks:
   - Find all tasks marked as done: `- [x]`, `✅`, etc.
   - Verify completion in codebase
   - Check for any follow-up needed

2) Archive completed items:
   - Move to "Completed" section
   - Add completion date if available
   - Keep brief notes if helpful
   - Remove if truly obsolete

3) Review remaining tasks:
   - Verify they're still relevant
   - Update priorities if needed
   - Check for duplicates
   - Merge similar tasks

4) Organize active tasks:
   - Group by priority
   - Group by area
   - Show dependencies clearly
   - Highlight blockers

5) Update list structure:
   - Clear sections (Active, Completed, Blocked)
   - Summary statistics
   - Next actions highlighted

## OUTPUT

Provide:
- Cleaned up TODO list
- Completed items archived
- Active tasks organized
- Summary statistics
- Next recommended actions
