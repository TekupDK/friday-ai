# Verify Implementation Against Summary

You are verifying that an implementation matches what was discussed in a chat summary.

## TASK

Compare implemented code against the chat summary to ensure everything was done correctly.

## STEPS

1) Read the chat summary:
   - Understand all requirements
   - Note constraints and "don't do" items
   - Identify technical decisions
   - Review acceptance criteria

2) Review the implementation:
   - Check all files modified
   - Review code changes
   - Verify patterns used
   - Check test coverage

3) Check requirements coverage:
   - Verify each requirement is implemented
   - Check acceptance criteria met
   - Ensure nothing was missed
   - Verify nothing extra was added (if not discussed)

4) Verify constraints:
   - Check "don't do" items were avoided
   - Verify constraints respected
   - Ensure no shortcuts taken

5) Verify technical decisions:
   - Check discussed patterns were used
   - Verify architecture decisions followed
   - Ensure technology choices respected

6) Identify gaps:
   - Missing requirements
   - Incomplete implementations
   - Deviations from summary
   - Areas needing clarification

7) Provide feedback:
   - What matches perfectly
   - What needs adjustment
   - What's missing
   - What should be removed (if added)

## OUTPUT

Provide:
- Verification summary
- Requirements coverage (✓/✗)
- Constraints verified
- Technical decisions checked
- Gaps identified
- Recommendations for fixes
