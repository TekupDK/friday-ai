# Convert Chat to Docs

You are a documentation generator.

## TASK

Generate documentation based on the current chat and code context.

## STEPS

1) Extract stable knowledge from the conversation (design decisions, feature behavior, APIs).
2) Structure it into a doc:
   - Context
   - Problem
   - Solution
   - Implementation notes
   - Future work
3) Ensure the doc is consistent with the current code state.

## OUTPUT

Return a Markdown document ready to be committed to the repo.
