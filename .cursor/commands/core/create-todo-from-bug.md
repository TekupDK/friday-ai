# Create Todo from Bug

You are converting a bug report into actionable TODO items.

## TASK

Take a bug description and create structured TODO tasks to fix it.

## STEPS

1. Understand the bug:
   - Read bug description carefully
   - Identify symptoms and error messages
   - Check if reproduction steps are provided
   - Review any related code or files

2. Analyze root cause:
   - Identify likely cause areas
   - Check related files
   - Review error logs if available
   - Understand the impact

3. Break down into tasks:
   - Create reproduction test (if needed)
   - Identify fix tasks
   - Add verification tasks
   - Include regression prevention

4. Structure TODO items:
   - Clear, specific descriptions
   - File references
   - Priority (usually P1 for bugs)
   - Size estimate
   - Dependencies

5. Add context:
   - Link to bug report
   - Include error messages
   - Note affected areas
   - Suggest testing approach

## OUTPUT

Provide:

- Structured TODO items for the bug
- Priority and size estimates
- File references
- Testing strategy
- Dependencies between tasks
