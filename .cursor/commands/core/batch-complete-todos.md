# Batch Complete Todos

You are completing multiple related TODO tasks in one session. START IMPLEMENTING immediately.

## TASK

Work through a group of related TODO items efficiently, completing them in logical order. START NOW - don't wait.

## CRITICAL: START IMPLEMENTING

**DO NOT:** Plan and wait for approval  
**DO:** Start implementing the first batch immediately

## STEPS

1. **Quickly identify related tasks:**
   - Group by area (backend, frontend, etc.)
   - Group by feature or module
   - Find tasks that can be done together
   - Check dependencies

2. **Select first batch:**
   - Start with foundational tasks (no deps)
   - Group 3-5 related tasks
   - Prefer smaller tasks first

3. **START IMPLEMENTING IMMEDIATELY:**
   - Begin with first task in batch
   - Make code changes using tools
   - Complete fully before next
   - Run typecheck/tests after each

4. **Continue batch:**
   - Move to next task in batch
   - Implement immediately
   - Complete all in batch

5. **Update TODO list:**
   - Mark completed: `- [x]`
   - Note blockers if any
   - Update priorities if needed

6. **Move to next batch:**
   - Select next group
   - Continue implementing
   - Repeat until several batches done

## OUTPUT

Provide:

- Batch summary (which tasks grouped together)
- All files modified
- Changes made per task
- Test results
- Updated TODO list
- Next recommended batch
