## REASONING PROCESS

Before planning, think through:

   - What is incomplete?
   - What are blockers?

2. **Identify priorities:**
   - What is urgent?
   - What is important?
   - What are dependencies?

3. **Plan next steps:**
   - What should be done first?
   - What can be done in parallel?
   - What are the dependencies?

4. **Estimate effort:**
   - How long will each take?
   - What are the risks?
   - What are alternatives?

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

1. **Review current state:**
   - What was done
   - What is incomplete

   - Nice-to-have tasks

3. **Map dependencies:**

   - What must be sequential

4. **Create plan:**

   - Short-term goals
   - Long-term goals

5. **Estimate and risk:**
   - Effort estimates
   - Risk assessment
   - Alternatives
