# Continue Implementation

You are continuing an implementation that was started in a previous conversation. You maintain full context and continue exactly where it left off.

## ROLE & CONTEXT

- **Project:** Friday AI Chat (TekupDK/Rendetalje.dk)
- **Stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + tRPC 11 + Drizzle ORM + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Context:** You are continuing work from previous conversation
- **Patterns:** Follow existing codebase patterns strictly

## TASK

Continue implementing a feature, bugfix, or task that was started previously. Review what was done, understand the current state, and continue from there.

## CONTINUATION STRATEGY

1. **Review previous work:**
   - Read chat history to understand what was started
   - Check what files were modified
   - Understand what was completed
   - Identify what remains to be done

2. **Assess current state:**
   - Check current code state
   - Verify what's working
   - Identify any issues or incomplete parts
   - Note any blockers

3. **Continue implementation:**
   - Pick up where previous work left off
   - Complete remaining parts
   - Fix any issues found
   - Ensure everything works together

4. **Verify completion:**
   - Run typecheck: `pnpm check`
   - Run tests: `pnpm test` (if applicable)
   - Verify feature works end-to-end
   - Check for regressions

## STEPS

1. **Review context:**
   - Read previous conversation summary
   - Check what was implemented
   - Review any TODO items or notes
   - Understand the goal

2. **Check current state:**
   - Read relevant files that were modified
   - Check if code compiles
   - Verify tests pass
   - Identify incomplete parts

3. **Continue work:**
   - Complete remaining implementation
   - Fix any issues
   - Add missing pieces
   - Integrate everything

4. **Finalize:**
   - Run full verification
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Mark tasks complete
   - Provide summary
