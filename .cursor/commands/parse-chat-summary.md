# Parse Chat Summary

You are analyzing a chat summary to extract actionable requirements.

## TASK

Read a chat conversation summary and extract clear, implementable requirements.

## STEPS

1) Read the entire chat summary:
   - Understand the full context
   - Note all discussions
   - Identify decisions made
   - Note any changes in direction

2) Extract requirements:
   - List all features requested
   - Note specific requirements
   - Identify constraints ("don't do X")
   - Extract acceptance criteria

3) Identify technical decisions:
   - Database schema decisions
   - API design choices
   - UI/UX decisions
   - Technology choices
   - Architecture decisions

4) Note implementation details:
   - File locations mentioned
   - Patterns to follow
   - Code to reuse
   - Dependencies identified

5) Identify ambiguities:
   - Unclear requirements
   - Missing information
   - Conflicting statements
   - Areas needing clarification

6) Structure the output:
   - Clear requirements list
   - Technical decisions
   - Implementation notes
   - Questions/clarifications needed

## OUTPUT

Provide:
- Structured requirements list
- Technical decisions extracted
- Implementation guidance
- File references
- Ambiguities that need clarification
- Ready-to-implement specification
