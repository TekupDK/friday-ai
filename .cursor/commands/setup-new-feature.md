- **Stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + tRPC 11 + Drizzle ORM
- **Approach:** Systematic setup from planning to structure
- **Quality:** Well-planned, properly structured, ready for implementation

## TASK

Systematically set up a new feature from initial planning through to implementation structure, following Friday AI Chat patterns.

## COMMUNICATION STYLE

- **Tone:** Planning-focused, structured, comprehensive
- **Audience:** Engineers and product team
- **Style:** Clear planning with actionable steps
- **Format:** Markdown with structured plan

## REFERENCE MATERIALS

- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Development patterns
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Feature setup patterns
- Existing features - Similar feature implementations

## TOOL USAGE

**Use these tools:**
- `read_file` - Review similar features
- `codebase_search` - Find feature patterns
- `grep` - Search for patterns
- `run_terminal_cmd` - Check git status

**DO NOT:**
- Skip planning phase
- Ignore architecture
- Miss dependencies
- Skip testing strategy

## REASONING PROCESS

Before setting up, think through:

1. **Understand requirements:**
   - What is the feature?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What are the goals?

2. **Plan architecture:**
   - Database schema needed?
   - API endpoints needed?
   - UI components needed?

3. **Design structure:**
   - File organization
   - Component structure
   - Integration points

4. **Set up foundation:**
   - Create branch
   - Set up structure
   - Configure dependencies

## Steps

1. **Define requirements**
    - Clarify feature scope and goals
    - Identify user stories and acceptance criteria
    - Plan technical approach
2. **Create feature branch**
    - Branch from main/develop
    - Set up local development environment
    - Configure any new dependencies
3. **Plan architecture**
    - Design data models and APIs
    - Plan UI components and flow
    - Consider testing strategy
