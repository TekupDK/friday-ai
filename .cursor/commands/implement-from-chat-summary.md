# Implement from Chat Summary

You are implementing features based on a chat conversation summary. START IMPLEMENTING immediately.

## TASK

Read a chat summary and implement exactly what was discussed and agreed upon. START NOW - begin coding immediately.

## COMMUNICATION STYLE

- **Tone:** Action-oriented, implementation-focused, precise
- **Audience:** Developer implementing
- **Style:** Immediate action with progress updates
- **Format:** Markdown with implementation report

## REFERENCE MATERIALS

- Chat summary - Requirements and decisions
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Development patterns
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture
- Related code - Files to modify

## TOOL USAGE

**Use these tools:**
- Review chat summary - Understand requirements
- `read_file` - Read existing code
- `codebase_search` - Find patterns
- `grep` - Search for related code
- `search_replace` - Implement changes
- `run_terminal_cmd` - Run tests

**DO NOT:**
- Wait for approval
- Just plan without implementing
- Skip requirements
- Ignore constraints

## REASONING PROCESS

Before implementing, think through:

1. **Understand requirements:**
   - What was requested?
   - What are constraints?
   - What were decisions?

2. **Plan implementation:**
   - What files to modify?
   - What patterns to use?
   - What dependencies?

3. **Implement immediately:**
   - Start with foundation
   - Build systematically
   - Follow patterns
   - Add tests

4. **Verify:**
   - Requirements met
   - Constraints respected
   - Tests pass

## CRITICAL: START IMPLEMENTING IMMEDIATELY

**DO NOT:**
- Show a plan and wait for approval
- Ask "should I start?"
- Just summarize without implementing

**DO:**
- Start implementing the first requirement immediately
- Make actual code changes using tools
- Complete the full implementation
- Show progress as you work

## STEPS

1) Read the chat summary carefully:
   - Understand the full context of the conversation
   - Identify the main goal or feature requested
   - Note any specific requirements or constraints
   - Extract technical decisions made
   - Identify any design choices discussed

2) Parse requirements:
   - List all features to implement
   - Note acceptance criteria
   - Identify file locations mentioned
   - Understand dependencies
   - Note any "do not" constraints

3) Review existing code:
   - Check files mentioned in summary
   - Understand current implementation
   - Identify integration points
   - Review related code patterns

4) **START IMPLEMENTING IMMEDIATELY:**
   - Begin with foundational changes (DB schema, types)
   - **MAKE CODE CHANGES NOW** using tools
   - Implement backend logic
   - Add API/tRPC procedures
   - Build frontend components
   - Wire everything together
   - Add tests
   - Run typecheck/tests as you go

5) Verify against summary:
   - Check each requirement is met
   - Verify constraints are respected
   - Ensure design decisions are followed
   - Confirm nothing was missed

6) Test the implementation:
   - Run typecheck
   - Run relevant tests
   - Test manually if needed
   - Verify edge cases

## OUTPUT

Provide:
- Summary of what was implemented
- Files created/modified
- How each requirement was addressed
- Any deviations and why
- Test results
- Next steps if anything remains

## GUIDELINES

- **START IMMEDIATELY:** Begin implementing right away, don't wait
- **USE TOOLS:** Make actual file changes using search_replace, write, etc.
- **Follow the summary exactly** - Don't add features not discussed
- **Respect constraints** - If something was explicitly avoided, don't do it
- **Use discussed patterns** - Follow technical decisions from the chat
- **Make reasonable assumptions** - If unclear, proceed with best judgment
- **Complete the full scope** - Don't leave partial implementations
- **SHOW PROGRESS:** Report as you complete each part
