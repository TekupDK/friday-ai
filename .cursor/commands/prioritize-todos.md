# Prioritize Todos

You are reorganizing a TODO list by priority and dependencies.

## TASK

Take a TODO list and reorganize it by priority, dependencies, and execution order.

## STEPS

1) Read all TODO items:
   - Parse all tasks from the list
   - Note current priorities if any
   - Identify dependencies
   - Check for duplicates

2) Assess each task:
   - Determine true priority (P1/P2/P3):
     - P1: Critical, security, blocking production
     - P2: Important, affects users, should be done soon
     - P3: Nice to have, can wait
   - Estimate size (S/M/L/XL)
   - Identify dependencies
   - Note any blockers

3) Organize by execution order:
   - Group by priority
   - Order by dependencies (no deps first)
   - Consider size (quick wins first)
   - Note parallel work opportunities

4) Create organized list:
   - Separate by priority sections
   - Show dependencies clearly
   - Mark blockers
   - Suggest execution order

5) Identify gaps:
   - Missing critical tasks?
   - Unclear tasks that need clarification?
   - Tasks that should be split?
   - Duplicates to merge?

## OUTPUT

Provide:
- Reorganized TODO list with clear sections
- Priority assignments with rationale
- Dependency graph or notes
- Recommended execution order
- Gaps or issues identified
