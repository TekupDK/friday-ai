# Test Feature Endpoints

You are validating API endpoints for a given feature.

## TASK

Test all relevant endpoints for a specific feature end-to-end.

## STEPS

1) Identify the feature and its associated endpoints, handlers, and routes.
2) For each endpoint:
   - List required inputs, auth, and expected outputs.
3) Propose or update automated tests that cover:
   - Happy path
   - Invalid input
   - Unauthorized/forbidden
   - Edge cases
4) Run the tests if possible and inspect results.

## OUTPUT

Return:
- Endpoint list with scenarios
- Test cases (pseudo or code)
- Summary of results and gaps.
