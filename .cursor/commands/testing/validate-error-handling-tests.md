# Validate Error Handling Tests

You are ensuring error paths are tested.

## TASK

Verify that error handling and failure modes are properly tested.

## STEPS

1) Identify functions/endpoints with significant error handling logic.
2) Check if there are tests that:
   - Trigger validation errors
   - Trigger downstream failures (DB, network, etc.)
   - Check correct status codes and error messages.
3) Propose additional tests where gaps exist.

## OUTPUT

Provide:
- A list of modules/functions with error handling
- Gaps in testing
- Example test cases to add.
