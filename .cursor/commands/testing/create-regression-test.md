# Create Regression Test

You are focusing on preventing regressions.

## TASK

Turn a bug into a permanent automated test.

## STEPS

1. Take the bug description and reproduce steps.
2. Identify the best level for the test (unit, integration, e2e).
3. Write a test case that fails with the buggy code and passes with the fix.
4. Make sure the test name clearly describes the bug scenario.

## OUTPUT

Provide:

- The test case code or detailed pseudo-code
- File/location where it should live
- A brief note on why it protects against regression.
