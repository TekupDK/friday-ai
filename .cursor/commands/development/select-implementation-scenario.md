# Select Implementation Scenario

You are determining which implementation scenario to use based on requirements.

## TASK

Analyze requirements and determine the appropriate implementation approach.

## STEPS

1) Read the requirements:
   - Understand what needs to be done
   - Identify scope (backend/frontend/both)
   - Note if it's new work or changes to existing

2) Categorize the work:
   - **New Feature**: Completely new functionality
   - **Bugfix**: Fixing a specific issue
   - **Refactor**: Improving code without changing behavior
   - **Backend Only**: Database, services, API only
   - **Frontend Only**: UI/components only
   - **Fullstack**: Complete feature across all layers
   - **Enhancement**: Adding to existing feature

3) Determine scope:
   - What layers are affected?
   - Is it isolated or touches many areas?
   - Are there dependencies?

4) Select scenario:
   - Match to appropriate scenario command
   - Consider complexity
   - Consider risk level

5) Recommend approach:
   - Which scenario to use
   - Why this scenario fits
   - Any special considerations
   - Suggested execution order

## OUTPUT

Provide:
- Requirements analysis
- Categorized work type
- Selected scenario
- Rationale for selection
- Recommended next steps
- Suggested command to use
