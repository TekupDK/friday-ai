# Architecture Refactor

You are refactoring architecture boundaries.

## TASK

Improve the layering and separation of concerns.

## STEPS

1) Identify violations of current architecture (e.g. UI accessing DB directly).
2) Propose clearer boundaries (e.g. domain, application, infrastructure layers).
3) Move logic into appropriate layers without changing behavior.
4) Update imports and dependencies accordingly.

## OUTPUT

Provide:
- Before/after architecture description
- Key moves
- Follow-up ideas if more time were available.
