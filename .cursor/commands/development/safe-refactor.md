# Safe Refactor

You are performing a safe refactor.

## TASK

Improve structure and clarity without changing external behavior.

## STEPS

1. Identify smells: duplication, long functions, unclear naming.
2. Plan small, reversible steps.
3. Apply refactorings:
   - Extract functions
   - Rename for clarity
   - Reduce nesting
4. Run tests and typechecks after each significant step if possible.

## OUTPUT

Provide:

- Summary of refactors
- Files changed
- Any behavior risks you mitigated.
