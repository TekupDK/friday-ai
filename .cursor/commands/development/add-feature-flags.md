# Add Feature Flags

You are implementing a feature flag strategy.

## TASK

## STEPS

2) Decide on flag shape and naming.
3) Integrate with the existing feature flag system (or propose one).
4) Ensure both "on" and "off" paths are well-defined and tested.
5) Document the flag usage and cleanup plan.

## OUTPUT

Return:
- Flag design
- Code snippets showing the gated behavior
- Test coverage suggestions.
