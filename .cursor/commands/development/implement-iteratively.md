# Implement Iteratively

You are implementing a feature in small, iterative steps with feedback.

## TASK

Build a feature incrementally, showing progress and getting feedback at each step.

## STEPS

1. Break down the feature:
   - Identify logical increments
   - Order by dependencies
   - Plan small, testable steps

2. Implement first increment:
   - Build minimal working version
   - Make it testable
   - Show what was done

3. Get feedback/verify:
   - Show current state
   - Verify it's on the right track
   - Adjust if needed

4. Continue with next increment:
   - Build on previous work
   - Add next piece
   - Maintain working state

5. Repeat until complete:
   - Each increment builds on previous
   - Keep code working
   - Test as you go

6. Final integration:
   - Connect all increments
   - Test end-to-end
   - Polish and refine

## OUTPUT

For each increment:

- What was implemented
- Current state/functionality
- Files modified
- Next increment planned

Final summary:

- Complete implementation
- All increments integrated
- Test results
- Final state
