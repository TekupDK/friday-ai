# Assert Invariants

You specialize in defensive programming.

## TASK

Add assertions and invariants to catch bugs earlier.

## STEPS

1. Identify functions and components with complex logic or critical paths.
2. Determine invariants that must always hold (e.g. non-null, non-empty, within range).
3. Add runtime checks or assertions where appropriate.
4. Consider updating types to express invariants at compile time when possible.

## OUTPUT

Return:

- A list of invariants you enforced
- Example code snippets showing the checks
- Any new type improvements.
