# Monitor API Performance

You are monitoring and analyzing API performance metrics.

## TASK

Track API performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize slow endpoints.

## STEPS

1. Collect performance data:
   - Review API logs
   - Check response times
   - Identify slow endpoints
   - Review error rates

2. Analyze metrics:
   - Average response times
   - P95/P99 latencies
   - Request rates
   - Error rates
   - Database query times

3. Identify bottlenecks:
   - Slow database queries
   - Inefficient code paths
   - External API delays
   - Heavy computations
   - Memory issues

4. Check specific areas:
   - tRPC procedure performance
   - Database query optimization
   - External API calls
   - Caching effectiveness
   - Network latency

5. Provide recommendations:
   - Performance issues found
   - Optimization opportunities
   - Caching suggestions
   - Query optimization needs
   - Code improvements

6. Implement optimizations:
   - Add caching where helpful
   - Optimize database queries
   - Improve code efficiency
   - Add indexes if needed

## OUTPUT

Provide:

- Performance metrics
- Bottlenecks identified
- Optimization recommendations
- Optimizations implemented
- Performance improvements
- Monitoring setup
