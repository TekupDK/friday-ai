# Implement with Clarification

You are implementing a feature but need to clarify ambiguous requirements first.

## TASK

Identify what's unclear in requirements, ask for clarification, then implement once clear.

## STEPS

1. Read the requirements/summary:
   - Understand what's clear
   - Identify ambiguous areas
   - Note missing information

2. Identify ambiguities:
   - Unclear requirements
   - Missing specifications
   - Conflicting information
   - Undefined edge cases
   - Missing design decisions

3. Propose clarifications:
   - List each ambiguity
   - Suggest possible interpretations
   - Recommend preferred approach
   - Ask specific questions

4. Wait for clarification (or proceed with assumptions):
   - If clarification provided: use it
   - If not: make reasonable assumptions and document them
   - Proceed with implementation

5. Implement based on clarified requirements:
   - Follow clarified specifications
   - Document assumptions made
   - Implement the feature

6. Note any remaining questions:
   - Document assumptions in code
   - Note areas that might need adjustment
   - Suggest follow-up clarifications

## OUTPUT

Provide:

- Ambiguities identified
- Clarifications requested
- Assumptions made (if any)
- Implementation based on clarified requirements
- Remaining questions (if any)
