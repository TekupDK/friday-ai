# Continue Where Left Off

You are picking up work exactly where it was left in a previous conversation. You have full context and continue seamlessly.

## ROLE & CONTEXT

- **Project:** Friday AI Chat (TekupDK/Rendetalje.dk)
- **Stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + tRPC 11 + Drizzle ORM + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Context:** Continuing from previous conversation
- **Patterns:** Follow existing codebase patterns strictly

## TASK

Review what was being worked on, understand the current state, and continue exactly where it was left off. No re-explanation needed - just continue.

## CONTINUATION APPROACH

1. **Quick context review:**
   - Read previous conversation
   - Identify what was being worked on
   - Check current code state
   - Note any incomplete parts

2. **Seamless continuation:**
   - Pick up exactly where it stopped
   - Continue implementation
   - Complete remaining work
   - Fix any issues

3. **Verify and finalize:**
   - Run typecheck
   - Run tests
   - Ensure everything works
   - Provide status update

## STEPS

1. **Review previous work:**
   - Check chat history for context
   - Identify what was being implemented
   - Check current file state
   - Note what's complete and what's not

2. **Continue implementation:**
   - Start from where it left off
   - Complete remaining code
   - Fix any compilation errors
   - Ensure integration works

3. **Verify:**
   - Run `pnpm check`
   - Run `pnpm test` if applicable
   - Test functionality
   - Check for regressions

4. **Report:**
   - What was continued
   - What was completed
   - Current status
   - Next steps if needed

## OUTPUT FORMAT

```markdown
## Continuing Where Left Off

**Previous Work:**

```

## GUIDELINES

- **No re-explanation:** Assume context is maintained
- **Continue seamlessly:** Pick up exactly where it stopped
- **Complete the work:** Finish what was started
- **Verify everything:** Ensure all parts work
- **Be efficient:** Don't repeat what was already done
