2. Identify any missing or misleading logs.
3. Propose improved logging (level, message, context).
4. Suggest changes to tracing/monitoring if relevant.

## OUTPUT

Return:

- Suspected failure points
- Suggested log lines (with level and structure)
- Any insights about performance or resource use.
